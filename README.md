## Introduction

Portal 2D is based on the video puzzle-platform games Portal (2007), and Portal 2 (2011) developed Valve.

The game is made in the [Godot Game-Engine](https://godotengine.org/) and was developed for Version 3.2.

## Contributions

Contributions for new levels, test-elements, modes, graphics, and especially sounds are very much welcome. 

The game was initially created as a university project and has been made available open-source. While the graphics and code are entirely created by us, the first prototype contained sounds from the original game that had to be removed for the open-source release. Sounds have been replaced with empty.wav, so they can easily be swapped for actual sounds again.

If you're interested in creating sounds for the game but don't have a lot of experience with coding, please don't hesitate to reach out anyway!
